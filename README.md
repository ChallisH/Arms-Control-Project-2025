# Oregon State Univeristy NSE Senior Design 2025: A Vision for the Future of Nuclear Arms Control
This code library is a collection of the open-source version of the Pu-600 algorithm and various helper-codes designed by Jes-c Tessman, Challis Holloway, Hayden Forster, and Leo VanderWhitte Ma. This project was sponsored by Dr. Cammile Palmer, and Tanner Heatherly. 

The priamry function of this algorithm is to determine the isotpic ratio of Pu-239 to Pu-240 from an input spectrum and output a binary output that states whether or not the item emmiting the spectra does or does not contain weapons grade plutonium. The ultimate goal of establishing this algorithm as open source is to faciliate transperency within the domain of nuclear arms control and by extention facilitating greater nuclear safety and security. 

This algorithm is designed to run in a version 3.10.16 python environment with the following librariess: 
- [Sandia National Labs: SpecUtils](https://github.com/sandialabs/SpecUtils)
- [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: Becquerel](https://github.com/lbl-anp/becquerel)
