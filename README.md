# Oregon State University NSE Senior Design 2025: A Vision for the Future of Nuclear Arms Control
This code library is a collection of the open-source version of the Pu-600 algorithm and various helper-codes designed by Jes-c Tessman, Challis Holloway, Hayden Forster, and Leo VanderWhitte Ma. This project was sponsored by Dr. Cammile Palmer and Tanner Heatherly.

The primary function of this algorithm is to determine the isotopic ratio of Pu-240 to Pu-239 from an input spectrum and output a binary output that states whether or not the item emitting the spectra does or does not contain weapons-grade plutonium. The ultimate goal of establishing this algorithm as open source is to facilitate transparency within the domain of nuclear arms control and, by extension, facilitate greater nuclear safety and security.

This algorithm is designed to run in a version 3.10.16 Python environment with the following libraries:
- [Sandia National Labs: SpecUtils](https://github.com/sandialabs/SpecUtils)
- [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: Becquerel](https://github.com/lbl-anp/becquerel)
